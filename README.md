Touch typing is the ability to use muscle memory to type very quickly, without relying on the keyboard, while using all ten fingers. It significantly improves typing speed and eliminates errors. Touch typing simply makes you more productive and it is a skill worth learning. Many people engage in the bad habit of 'hunt-and-peck' typing, even those seasoned professionals with years and decades of computer experience. It is easy to understand, though, as touch typing requires dedicated practice to  learn it well.

This app does not force you to repeat the same letters over and over again; like 'gf gfgf gf'; Instead, using a subword dictionary it generates random, yet frequent subwords of the English language.
